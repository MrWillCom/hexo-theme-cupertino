# LaTeX

$LaTeX$. You don't need to change any theme config exactly, and you can choose the renderer you like from the following:

- [hexo-math](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-math)
- [Hexo Filter MathJax](https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-filter-mathjax)

Just follow their documentation to install them, no further configuration required.
